TODO
- handle when trade group both has MINI and MICRO
- ALL_ACCOUNT incorrect on April 29 log (it includes only the EXPRESS account trades)
- increase refresh to 5 seconds (measure CPU, memory etc)
    before that though - check file modified first (check) - test on live market (that it's working as expected)
    then analyze logs first for how much gaps in secs between HH:mm:ss INFO entries (by frequency) - to pick optimal refresh time

improvements
- clarify config/defaults if secs, ms, mins (be as consistent as possible)
- support for multi contract symbol+value

separate analysis
- time of day analysis on - atr(5) * volume
